# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  the lack of proper error handling within route handlers that interact with databases or other external services.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database.  Crucially, it lacks robust error handling. If the database query fails (e.g., due to a network issue, invalid user ID, or database error), the application crashes silently or provides an unhelpful generic error message to the client.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version with improved error handling.  It explicitly checks for errors returned by the database operation and responds appropriately, providing informative error messages to the client while preventing server crashes.
